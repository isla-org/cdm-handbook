# CDM Handbook
This repository contains all the resources used within the CDM Handbook for Securities Lending as published and maintained by the International Securities Lending Association (ISLA). 

The handbook is a best practice guide to how to implement the FINOS Common Domain Model (CDM) for securities lending use cases.

The repository is split into folders for versions of the CDM, with each folder containing the resources and examples that pertain to that version.
